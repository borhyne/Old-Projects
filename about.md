I recently made the move to San Francisco after finishing my MBA at UNC and traveling through Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia over the summer.

### More Information

Before business school, I was a Mechanical Design Engineer on a Nuclear Power Plant in Augusta, GA. The work was fun and the commute was long and after a few years was ready for something new.
               
Growing up, I was always building RC planes and fixing things around the house which led me into Mechanical Engineering. I love playing tennis, soccer and golf and doing anything outdoors.
