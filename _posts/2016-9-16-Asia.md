title: 4 Months in Asia
---

After finishing my MBA in May, I went to Asia to explore a part of the world I had never been to with my girlfriend, Whitney. At the end of the trip we tried to figure out what questions people would ask and summaried some of them here. Ask me more and I'll include them!

Whitney and I traveled through Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia from May until September of 2016.

### What was your favorite place?

I answer this by asking where would I go back?

And the two places I would want to explore more are Nepal and Indonesia. 

## Nepal
In Nepal we did the Everest Base Camp trek. Being was surrounded my the Himalayas for two weeks was unlike any hiking I've ever done. Whitney and would both love to get back to Nepal to do the Annapurna and Manaslu Circuit Treks.

Lukla Airport - "The most dangerous airport in the world"

## Indonesia
If you went to an island a day in Indonesia it would take you 49 years to go to all of them. Everywhere we went there were volcanoes, beaches, monkeys and world class scuba diving.
